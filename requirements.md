# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an AI-integrated Supply Chain Management (SCM) application. The system will provide comprehensive inventory management, order processing, demand forecasting, and intelligent chatbot assistance using Flask backend, React frontend, and MySQL database. The application aims to streamline supply chain operations through automation and AI-powered insights.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a supply chain manager, I want to manage user authentication and authorization, so that I can ensure secure access to the SCM system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to register THEN the system SHALL validate email format and password strength
2. WHEN a user logs in with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL generate a JWT token and grant access
3. WHEN a user accesses protected routes without authentication THEN the system SHALL redirect to login page
4. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically log them out and require re-authentication

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an inventory manager, I want to perform CRUD operations on inventory items, so that I can maintain accurate stock levels and product information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new inventory item THEN the system SHALL validate required fields (name, SKU, quantity, price)
2. WHEN I view inventory items THEN the system SHALL display items in a paginated table with search and filter capabilities
3. WHEN I update an item's quantity THEN the system SHALL log the change and update the database immediately
4. WHEN I delete an item THEN the system SHALL soft-delete the record and maintain audit trail
5. WHEN stock levels fall below minimum threshold THEN the system SHALL generate low-stock alerts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a procurement officer, I want to manage orders and transactions, so that I can track purchase orders and supplier relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new order THEN the system SHALL validate supplier information and item availability
2. WHEN an order is submitted THEN the system SHALL update inventory quantities and order status
3. WHEN I view orders THEN the system SHALL display order history with filtering by date, supplier, and status
4. WHEN an order is completed THEN the system SHALL automatically update inventory levels
5. IF an order exceeds budget limits THEN the system SHALL require approval workflow

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a supply chain analyst, I want AI-powered demand forecasting, so that I can predict future inventory needs and optimize stock levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request demand forecast THEN the system SHALL analyze historical data using Prophet or LSTM models
2. WHEN forecast is generated THEN the system SHALL display predictions with confidence intervals
3. WHEN new sales data is available THEN the system SHALL automatically retrain forecasting models
4. WHEN forecast accuracy drops below threshold THEN the system SHALL alert administrators
5. IF insufficient historical data exists THEN the system SHALL use industry benchmarks or similar products

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a supply chain user, I want an intelligent chatbot assistant, so that I can get quick answers about inventory, orders, and SCM best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I ask about inventory levels THEN the chatbot SHALL query the database and provide current stock information
2. WHEN I request order status THEN the chatbot SHALL retrieve and display order details
3. WHEN I ask SCM-related questions THEN the chatbot SHALL provide relevant advice using OpenAI integration
4. WHEN the chatbot cannot answer a query THEN it SHALL escalate to human support
5. WHEN I interact with the chatbot THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context and history

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive data management and reporting, so that I can monitor system performance and generate business insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide inventory turnover, order analytics, and forecast accuracy metrics
2. WHEN data is imported/exported THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity and format compliance
3. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL maintain transaction consistency
5. IF data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL trigger backup restoration procedures

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a supply chain manager, I want a responsive dashboard interface, so that I can access the system from various devices and get real-time insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display key metrics, alerts, and recent activities
2. WHEN I use mobile devices THEN the interface SHALL adapt to different screen sizes
3. WHEN data updates occur THEN the dashboard SHALL refresh automatically or show real-time updates
4. WHEN I navigate between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent UI/UX patterns
5. IF network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL provide offline capabilities for critical functions
